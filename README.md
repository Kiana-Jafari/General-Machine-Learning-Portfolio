### Machine Learning Projects

1. Classification of TikTok videos: Used SVC, KNN, and scikit-learn to predict whether videos presented claims or opinions to improve triaging process of videos for human review 

2. Classification of Salifort Motors data: Built decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost to predict Company's user churn

3. Used multiple regression to predict taxi fares, data that would be used as part of a suite of models to optimize revenue for the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission and its drivers
