# Machine Learning

### Technical Skills
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL, HTML

- Python Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, scikit-learn

- Machine Learning Models: regression (linear, logistic, ridge, lasso, elasticNet), Support Vector Machine, 
- Naive Bayes, decision trees, random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, 
- Clustering (K-means)

### Machine Learning Projects

- Classification of TikTok videos: Used SVC, KNN, and scikit-learn to predict whether videos presented claims or opinions to improve triaging process of videos for human review 

- Classification of Salifort Motors data: Built decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost to predict Company's user churn

- Used multiple regression to predict taxi fares, data that would be used as part of a suite of models to optimize revenue for the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission and its drivers
